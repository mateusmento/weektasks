On backlog page

I want to everything related to sprint and backlog composition

Grooming
Backlog items
Sprints
Sprint periods
Start/End sprint
Scrum Team
Estimation

But thats not quite optimal

I want to bring together a few stuff

meetings notifications
backlog
sprints
product infos
estimations
schedules
initiate call meetings
collaboratos profile cards

Timeline for

- Meetings schedules
- Sprint cerimonies
- Due dates

Teams should be coordinates based on time within sprints

So time here is important
A lot of stuff will happen during sprint
like meetings, sprint cerimonies, efforts (events in general)
So it's important to keep track of what's
happening and what will happen

Along side that it's important to bring together
the timeline and communication for the team based
on events and discussions

With that I think a page is emerging for focusing
on the team, allowing communication and coordination.

So for that I think beyond timeline and discussions
I think its important to bring together efforts
in progress within current sprint

efforts, discussions and events for current sprint
are all part of this page.

Also in this page, it should be able to create schedules,
initiate meetings and cerimonies, communicate feedback
and post discussions

Also, it's a perfect place where infos about the team and product can be, like
team's collaborators, product name and configurations like sprint durations.
